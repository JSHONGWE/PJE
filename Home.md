    <h1>Identified Problem</h1>
       <p>South Africa is in a midst of a housing and settlement crisis in which <b>undocumented foreing nationals and poverty stricken South Africans</b> live in shack
           settlements, the nature of these settlements leads to a cascading effect of burned down 
           homes, if one shack happens to catch fire the entire clustured settlement could burn down resulting in a loss of life
       </p>

    <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
       <p>The problem shall be solved in two stages, those stages being:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>Preventive</li>
           <li>Early detection and warning system</li>
       </ol>
       
       <h2>Preventive</h2>
       <p>
       Percolation in the spread of fires, this stage focuses on the design of the settlement
       and the use of a Percolation model to minimise the spread of a fire to all of the shacks in the settlement.
       </p>

       <h2>Early detection and warning system</h2>
       <p>An early detection and warning system will be developed in that at the event of a fire the
           whole settlement will be alerted of such an occurance.
       </p>
       <p>The early detection system will be implemented using  smoke and heat detectors, while the
           warning system will make use of visible light communication to alert people of the fire.

      I am Jonase Shongwe, an Engineer in the making who is extreamly passionate about community development.
           I am mostly focused on using the engineering knowledge and skills learned to aid in the safety and
           development of my community. With housing being an issue in impoverished communities across the
           country, as seen in the fire insident at the [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2FoYkWY90g&ab_channel=CapeTownTV">Joe Slovo Informal Settlement</a>]. My project aims to curb 
           the devastating effects of such incidents.
